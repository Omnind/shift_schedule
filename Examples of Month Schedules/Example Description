      - Each day is divided into three 8-hour shifts. Each shift type requires different number of employees.

        - B-sfhit：08:00-16:00（3 employees required）
        - C-shift：16:00-24:00（3 employees required）
      - Every day, no employee works more than one shift.
      - Number of shifts are evenly assigned to employees.

    two adjacent days.
