# Intelligent Shift Scheduling 
智能排班

Ceating and revising an employee shift schedule can be an extremely complex optimization problem. This App are powered by following features:
1. Models and solves a wide range of shift scheduling problems which are categorized by different number of shifts per day. Currently,  1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8 shifts/day are suppored.
2. A variety of basic shift constraints are presented for scheduling selection. They can be combined/grouped to form very complicated contraints to cope with different real world requirements.
3. Incremental and iterative optimization is the core strategy in building a satisfactory shift schedule. 
4. Reactive scheduling algorithm with constraint addition and removal plays a major role in dealing with the frequently changing needs (e.g. availability change of employees).
5. This App is characterized by a high degree of flexibility. It is capable of dealing with simple to complicated scheduling tasks. In a simple schedule task, a small number of staffs and shifts per day specified, creating and repairing schedules can be easily operated by just selection and click. For a complicated task,  a large number of staffs and a bit more shifts per day specified, more complicated mechnisms/tools are available to meet these chanllenges (e.g. decompsition of a problem and merging multiple scheduling results to form the final results).
6. For each employee in a schedule cycle, the number and type of shifts, the number of day-off and the total number of working hours are comprehasively considered and handled. The employees' needs and companies' requirements can be well balanced with constraint adjustment and optimization algorithms.
7. Schedule tables are presented as visible results. Customizable integrations tools are available to communicate with external system (e.g. import employee data into the system, output schedule results to excel file etc.)
8. The results from this App can provide useful references for mangement to optimize the employment struture, to minimize the total number of staffs and the administrative costs.

# Shift-Scheduling Examples
员工轮班计划: 该如何做规律的三班倒排班?

现在共有9人，做轮换排班。
A班：0：00-8：00（仅限一人。且每人在同一个月平均一些，如果不平均在下个月也可以有补充。）
B班：8：00-16：00（共三人。不限次数。）
C班：16：00-24：00（共三人。不限次数。）
每个月按照有几个法定休息日进行休息。例如这个月共有五个周六，四个周日，那就是休息9天。

在这个轮班计划里，有四个员工一周必须工作四十八小时.
