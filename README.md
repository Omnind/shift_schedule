# Intelligent Shift Scheduling 
智能排班

Satisfactory employee shift schedules can be extremely hard to create and alter. This app is designed and developed to use AI optimization technologies to address such issues. It is powered by the following features:
1. The number of shifts in each day is used to categorize and model a wide range of employee shift scheduling problems. Currently, 1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8 shifts per day are supported.
2. Employee shift schedules can be created, revised, and iteratively optimized with the equipped reliable and effective scheduling engines.
3. A collection of fundamental shift scheduling constraints extracted and derived from common and frequently-used schedule requests are presented for scheduling decision-making. They can be combined to form very complex constraints to meet various real-world demands. 
4. Reactive scheduling with constraint addition and removal plays a major role in dealing with the frequently changing needs. A minimal changed solution aginst the existing schedule is sorted in reponding to the new request.
5. This software is also characterized by a high degree of flexibility. It is capable of fullfilling simple to complicated scheduling tasks. In a simple one, a small number of staffs and shifts per day specified, creating and repairing schedules can be as easy as selection and click. For a complicated task,  a large number of staffs and a bit more shifts per day specified, more complicated mechnisms/tools are available to meet these chanllenges (e.g. decompsition of a problem and merging multiple scheduling results to form the final results).
6. For each employee in a schedule cycle, the number and type of shifts, the number of day-off and the total number of working hours he takes are comprehasively considered and handled. The employees' needs and companies' requirements are well balanced with constraint adjustment and optimization algorithms.
7. Schedule tables are presented as visible results. Customizable integrations tools are available to communicate with external system (e.g. import employee data into the system, output schedule results to excel file etc.)
8. The results of this application can maximally satify the personal needs and provide useful references for mangement to optimize the employment struture, to minimize the total number of staffs and the administrative costs.

# Shift-Scheduling Examples
员工轮班计划: 该如何做规律的三班倒排班?

现在共有9人，做轮换排班。
A班：0：00-8：00（仅限一人。且每人在同一个月平均一些，如果不平均在下个月也可以有补充。）
B班：8：00-16：00（共三人。不限次数。）
C班：16：00-24：00（共三人。不限次数。）
每个月按照有几个法定休息日进行休息。例如这个月共有五个周六，四个周日，那就是休息9天。

在这个轮班计划里，有四个员工一周必须工作四十八小时.
